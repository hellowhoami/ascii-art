# ascii-art
Shell-scripts archive for echoing ASCII art in shell.

This takes advantage of Github's CLI to transfer ASCII art to a command-line-only Linux machine.

# Examples:

Download the archive:
git clone 

Make a script executable:
~$ sudo chmod u+x ascii-art/scripts/cilantro.sh

Run a script:
~$ ./ascii-art/scripts/cilantro.sh
